# Session Handoff Procedure

Execute the streamlined 5-step session handoff procedure focused on preserving maximum context awareness, tracking progress, and ensuring clean git state for seamless AI assistant session transitions.

## Instructions

Follow this optimized process prioritizing context preservation and documentation:

### Step 1: Progress Assessment & Documentation
Capture comprehensive session context:
- **Key Accomplishments**: Features implemented, bugs fixed, improvements made
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture choices, implementation approaches, and rationale
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Problems encountered and how they were resolved
- **Code Changes**: Modified files, new features, refactored components
- **Configuration Updates**: Environment changes, dependency updates, setting modifications

### Step 2: Context Preservation
Document critical context for next session:
- **Current Working State**: What was being worked on when session ended
- **File Locations**: Key files modified or created, important paths to remember
- **Implementation Details**: Partial work, temporary solutions, work-in-progress notes
- **Decision Context**: Why certain approaches were chosen, alternatives considered
- **Session Learning**: Insights gained, patterns discovered, gotchas identified

### Step 3: Documentation Updates
Update project documentation to reflect current reality:
- **CLAUDE.md Updates**: Modify session handoff section with latest achievements
- **README Updates**: Reflect new features, changed workflows, updated instructions
- **Technical Docs**: Update architecture notes, API changes, configuration guides
- **Known Issues**: Document any discovered bugs, limitations, or workarounds
- **Development Notes**: Capture design decisions and implementation rationale

### Step 4: Session Summary Creation & Handoff Documentation
Create comprehensive transition document in session-summaries folder:

```bash
# Create session-summaries folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p session-summaries

# Create session summary with current date and session number
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
SESSION_NUM=1
while [ -f "session-summaries/SESSION-SUMMARY-${DATE}-$(printf "%02d" $SESSION_NUM).md" ]; do
    SESSION_NUM=$((SESSION_NUM + 1))
done
FILENAME="session-summaries/SESSION-SUMMARY-${DATE}-$(printf "%02d" $SESSION_NUM).md"

cat > "$FILENAME" << EOF
# Session Summary - ${DATE} (Session $(printf "%02d" $SESSION_NUM))

## Accomplishments
- [Document what was accomplished in this session]
- [Key features implemented, bugs fixed, improvements made]
- [Configuration updates and technical decisions]

## Current Status
- **Current Branch**: [branch-name] with [description of state]
- **ISEE Framework Status**: Current capabilities and recent changes
- **Web UI State**: Latest improvements and functionality
- **Performance Metrics**: Current execution times and optimization status
- **Testing Status**: What was tested, what needs testing

## Next Session Priorities
- [ ] Most important next task with specific first steps
- [ ] Secondary priorities and estimated effort
- [ ] Potential blockers to watch for
- [ ] Known issues to address

## Configuration Notes
- **API Requirements**: OpenRouter API key status and configuration
- **Dependencies**: Any updated requirements or environment setup
- **Server Setup**: Development server configuration and startup requirements
- **Framework Configuration**: Cognitive frameworks, models, and domain settings

## Quick-start Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Essential commands for next session startup
python app.py                           # Start Flask development server
./scripts/dev-server.sh start          # Alternative server startup
http://localhost:5001/isee-ui          # Access Web UI
python tests/test_runner.py --quick    # Quick validation
\`\`\`

## Technical Context
- **File Locations**: Key files modified or created
- **Implementation Details**: Partial work, temporary solutions, work-in-progress
- **Architecture Notes**: Important design decisions and rationale
- **Code Changes**: Summary of modified components and new features

## Session Assessment
- **Session Duration**: [time] focused on [main objective]
- **Overall Progress**: [high-level assessment of advancement]
- **Quality of Work**: [assessment of code quality, documentation completeness]
- **Momentum Assessment**: [ready to continue, needs planning, facing blockers]
- **Confidence Level**: [how confident next session can continue effectively]

## Performance & Optimization
- **Current Performance**: ISEE execution times and efficiency metrics
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Identified areas for improvement
- **System Health**: Overall framework stability and reliability

### Step 5: Git Cleanup & Methodical Commit Process
Ensure clean repository state with systematic approach:

```bash
# 1. Assess current git state
git status
git diff --name-only
git log --oneline -5

# 2. Review staged vs unstaged changes
git diff --cached           # Review staged changes
git diff                   # Review unstaged changes

# 3. Methodical staging and committing (including session summary)
git add [specific-files]   # Stage files strategically
git add session-summaries/ # Include session summary in commit
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
session handoff: [concise description of main accomplishments]

- [specific change 1]
- [specific change 2] 
- [specific change 3]
- Added comprehensive session summary and handoff documentation

# 4. Verify clean state
git status                 # Should show "working tree clean"
```

**Document should include**:
- Current ISEE Meta Framework status and recent changes
- Web UI functionality and latest improvements
- Framework execution performance metrics
- Cognitive framework integration status and any issues
- Immediate priorities for next session
- Known issues with model integrations or execution
- Quick-start commands for context restoration
- API key and configuration requirements
- Development server setup and access information

## Expected Outcome

An efficient session handoff providing:
âœ… **Maximum Context Preservation** - All critical information captured for seamless continuation  
âœ… **Progress Documentation** - Clear record of accomplishments and current state  
âœ… **Clean Git State** - Methodical commits with proper attribution  
âœ… **Next Session Readiness** - Immediate actionable next steps  
âœ… **Comprehensive Handoff** - Complete transition documentation  

This streamlined procedure eliminates time-consuming validation while maximizing context continuity and development momentum across AI assistant sessions.
